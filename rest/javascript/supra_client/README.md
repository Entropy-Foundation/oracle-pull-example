# Javascript PullServiceClient for Supra Readme

This library is designed to interact with a rest api server for fetching proof data and then using that data to call a smart
contract on a blockchain network. This readme provides instructions on how to use the library and customize certain
components for your specific use case.

## Installation

To use the PullServiceClient library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the library's source code.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

# Usage

The library provides the main function, which fetches proof data from the rest api server using the specified parameters and
then calls a contract function on a blockchain network.

# Configuration

Before using the library, make sure to set up the configuration in the main.js file:

1. Set the rest api server address:

   ```js
   const address = 'rpc-testnet-dora-2.supra.com';
   ```
2. Set the pair indexes as an array:

   ```js
   const pairIndexes = [0, 21, 61, 49];
   ```

3. Set the chain type Aptos:

   ```js
   const chainType = 'aptos';
   ```

4. Configure the RPC URL for the desired blockchain network:

   ```js
   let supra_client = await SupraClient.init("<RPC ENDPOINT>");
   ```

# Customization

Users can customize the smart contract interaction under the callContract function. Specifically, you can modify the
following components:

1. **Smart Contract Address**: Set the address of your smart contract:
   ```js
   const contractAddress = '<CONTRACT ADDRESS>';
   ```

2. **Function Call**: Modify the function call according to your smart contract's methods. For example, if your smart contract has a module named `pull_example` & method named `get_pair_price`:
   ```js
   const moduleName = "pull_example";
   const functionName = "get_pair_price";
   ```

3. **Retrieve signer Account**: 
   ```bash
   const priv_key_bytes = Uint8Array.from(Buffer.from(privateKey, "hex"));
   const account = new SupraAccount(priv_key_bytes);
   ```

4. **Transaction Object**: Customize the transaction object as needed:
   ```js
   let supraRawTransaction = await supra_client.createRawTxObject(
    account.address(),
    (
      await supra_client.getAccountInfo(account.address())
    ).sequence_number,
    contractAddress,
    moduleName,
    functionName,
    [],
    [
        BCS.bcsSerializeBytes(response.proof_bytes)
    ]
   );
   ```

# Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command

```bash
node main.js
```

This will initiate the fetching of proof data and interaction with the smart contract based on the provided
configuration and customization.
